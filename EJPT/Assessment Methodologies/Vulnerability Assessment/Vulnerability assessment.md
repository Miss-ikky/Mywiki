### Vulnerability 

- A weakness in the computational logic found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity or availability 
- Vulnerability comes from software or operating system 
- CVE have identifiers (CVE-year-code) 
	- National vulnerability database (check base score) maintained by NIST 
	- CVE by US department of Homeland security 
- zero day attacks 
	- exploits that no one knows about or it doesn't have a patch yet. 
- steps: 
 1. Risk management 
	 1. Vulnerability management 
		 1. vulnerability assessment (manage vulnerability )
			 1. Penetration test (need to know which vul you have)
				 - Scanning 
				 - Asset identification + research 
				 - fuzz  testing (input/handling validation)
- when a machine with an identified vulnerability is found it should be remediated as soon it is identified in risk management process. 

  
  
  

### Case study 

**heartbleed**  
	- TLS encrypts data in transmission - openssl is the software that allows for that encryption. 
	- there are modules in metasploit en script in nmap for heartbleed

	  ![[Pasted image 20230616143241.png]]![[Pasted image 20230616143315.png]]Normal connection (public and private keys exchanged - shared key)
         The confirmation is based on password length but what happens if you send another password length (larger than password)

in the response the password is sent back filled with other data

This way you can ask more and more information (buffer overread). 

Buffer overread refers to a type of software vulnerability or programming error that occurs when a program reads data beyond the bounds of a buffer or array. In other words, it happens when a program attempts to access or retrieve more data from a buffer than what is actually available or allocated for that buffer. Buffers are temporary storage areas in computer memory that hold data, such as strings or arrays. They have a fixed size, determined by the programmer, and are designed to store a specific amount of data. When a program reads data from a buffer, it is expected to read only within the defined boundaries of the buffer.

**Eternal blue** 
- zero day exploit 
- smbv1 vulnerability 
- when OS was not patched then it was vulnerable 
- nmap scan script available

Nmap scan to check for smbv1 and if it is vulnerable for eternalblue 
![[Pasted image 20230616151909.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230616151937.png]]

check for eternalblue when you see old OS 




**Log4j** 

- set up ldap server and run malicious code 
-

java application use log4j voor logging - log application data
