### Vulnerability 

- A weakness in the computational logic found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity or availability 
- Vulnerability comes from software or operating system 
- CVE have identifiers (CVE-year-code) 
	- National vulnerability database (check base score) maintained by NIST 
	- CVE by US department of Homeland security 
- zero day attacks 
	- exploits that no one knows about or it doesn't have a patch yet. 
- steps: 
 1. Risk management 
	 1. Vulnerability management 
		 1. vulnerability assessment (manage vulnerability )
			 1. Penetration test (need to know which vul you have)
				 - Scanning 
				 - Asset identification + research 
				 - fuzz  testing (input/handling validation)
- when a machine with an identified vulnerability is found it should be remediated as soon it is identified in risk management process. 

  
  
  

### Case study 

- heartbleed  
	- TLS encrypts data in transmission - openssl is the software that allows for that encryption.
