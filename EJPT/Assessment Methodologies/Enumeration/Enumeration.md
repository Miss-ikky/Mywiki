##### Servers & services 

Server:  it services something to a user, provides some sort of functionality that can be utilized by other devices. 
- We pull resources from servers (e.g. email/files). 
- Server can be runing windows, linux, macos. every computer can be a server 
- servers need to be accessed remotely 

Services (program on a computer that does a specific function) running on a server: 
- require poning a listening port on the server and accepting connections remotly. 
- open the barrier and allow access to programm remotely 
- problem: misconfig or bugs that can give remote access to whole system 


Examples of services that you would see on a server 

#### SMB 
- Windows file share implementation 
- CIFS (generic version) works the same as SMB 
- port 445 
- netbios sets up session for smb 
-  Run an nmap scan for open ports ![[Pasted image 20230509105853.png]]
- Run scan for service enumeration on our OS

- nmap {target ip} -sV -sC  (sC runs basic scripts) ![[Pasted image 20230509104300.png]]
   helpfull smb enumeration 
- net use in powershell for smb ![[Pasted image 20230509105010.png]]


SMB Discover and Mount 
- Objective: Learn to use Nmap to scan the target machine and mount the SMB share of the target machine using the Windows File Explorer as well as using the command prompt.  Objective: Discover SMB share and mount it

Lab: 

1. ipconfig to get ip and check cidr 
2. nmap -T4 10.2.29.125/20 --open
