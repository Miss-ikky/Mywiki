1. run nmap to check services
2. visit the services via browser (if possible)
3. inspect page to find version
4. try to log in with default credentials (admins often do not change them) Google: default credentials of service 
5. if you can log in look for the version of the service 
6. search for vulnerability with searchsploit of the service

7. use -w with searchsploit and investigate on website of exploitable OR investigate manually: 
	1. `cd Desktop`
	2. `searchsploit -m exploit_db_code`
	3. `vim filename`
