**Content Discovery**  
-   Content Discovery: When we talk about content discovery, we're not talking about the obvious things we can see on a website; it's the things that aren't immediately presented to us and that weren't always intended for public access.  This content could be, for example, pages or portals intended for staff usage, older versions of the website, backup files, configuration files, administration panels, etc. 
-  Waar kunnen we zoeken? 
	- Manual Discovery 
		-  Robot.txt: doument that tells search engines which pages they are/arent allowed to show on their search engine results or ban from crawling. These pages may be areas such as administration portals or files meant for the website's customers. This file gives us a great list of locations on the website that the owners don't want us to discover as penetration testers. 
		- Favicon: Sometimes when frameworks are used to build a website, a favicon that is part of the installation gets leftover, and if the website developer doesn't replace this with a custom one, this can give us a clue on what framework is in use. OWASP host a database of common framework icons that you can use to check against the targets faviconÂ [https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_favicon_database](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_favicon_database). Once we know the framework stack, we can use external resources to discover more about it (see next section). ![[Pasted image 20230405120129.png]]
			- Usefull command:   curl {link to falvicon  to download it} | md5sum  
			- Use the md5sum to check the framework used 
		- Sitemap.xml file gives a list of every file the website owner whishes to be on the search engine -> visit url/sitemap.xml 
		- HTTP Headers can contain usefull information such as webserver software and programming/scripting language. 
			- Use curl command with -v (verbose mode) 
		- Framework stack -  learn more about the software and other information, possibly leading to more content we can discover.
